Musk's Wealth

Welcome to the Musk's Wealth website! This simple webpage showcases the vast wealth of Elon Musk using JavaScript. The site provides a visual representation of his net worth, showing how much good he could be doing with his money if he wanted to.

Technologies Used

Usage

    The webpage may not look great on smaller screens due to the lack of responsiveness, but it should work fine on standard desktop resolutions.

    Accuracy: The wealth calculation is based on rough estimates and might not reflect real-time changes.
